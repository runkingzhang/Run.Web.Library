    <p>My buddies and I had heard about this trail in November from a friend who had finished the West portion earlier in the month. It sounded like a good trail, but we didn't have time to check it out until last week.</p>
    <p>All I can say is wow! I really hate that I waited so long to try this trail, especially since it's right in my backyard (I live in Ventura).
      My friends and I got to the first trail head around 9:30 am that morning. The first portion of the trail were firebreaks and service roads, and for a while it seemed that we were just going to be going on another scenic ride.</p>
    <p>About two-thirds of the way up, we came to the first set of single-tracks breaking away from the firebreak. From then on the trail did not let up!</p>
    <p>Heavy on switchbacks (both on the climb and on the descent), and with good climbs, the trail alone is worth the trip! However, towards the top, we encountered a pretty strong technical section. Bare rock, small washouts, and loose rocks made for some slow going in areas. </p>
    <p>On the descent, the more technical nature of the trail keeps you from bombing out a run. A friend of mine that doesn't wish to be named (we'll call him Marty) is just starting out and we may have pushed him a bit too much! After the exhausting climb he didn't have much left for the downhill. He took two tumbles on the way down but thankfully wasn't hurt bad.</p>
    <p>Hitting the firebreaks again on the way down isn't a bad thing either. You can pick your speed up a bit here, and there are a few shallow hills that allow you to get some really good air.</p>
    <p>For this trip we just did the West trail. I'm really looking forward to going back in a few weeks to do the East trail as well!</p>

        <h2>Copper Canyon Loop</h2>

    <p>I’m going to be the first to admit, I don’t like technical climbs, and I don’t consider myself a good climber. That’s why, when my friend Heather asked me to go with her to the Copper Canyon Loop, or the “Coop” as it’s called, I hesitated. I’ve heard horror stories about the boulder climbs, poorly marked trails, and lack of trail upkeep. </p>
    <p>Regardless, she persisted and last week we made the 3 hour trek from Goleta to the canyon. All I can say is, thank goodness I went!</p>
    <p>If you ask me, the trail upkeep issue is over-rated. Over 80% of the trail is considered natural state, meaning there isn’t supposed to be upkeep past directional markings. I will admit that the trail markers can use some improvement. More than once Heather and I started to question if we were on the right trail until finally seeing a marker just before we turned around. If you’re not used to navigating through canyons, I’d bring a GPS device, more water than you think you’re going to need, and a healthy dose of patience.</p>
    <p>Other than the markings, the trail is a joy. Yes, there are some very technical climb sections, but they are few and far between and they simply provide the challenge for those that wish to take it on. I did not, and felt no shame at all in dismounting and carrying my bike up the more difficult sections. </p>
    <p>For me, the payoff was the ridgeline run that goes from the top of the canyon wall all the way down to the Copper River, 850 feet below. The descent is almost unbroken by switchbacks, and has an amazing amount of visibility. If you have the nerve, you can build a lot of speed before getting to the mogul jump section at the bottom. It’s not for the faint of heart however, as there are no rails, and no bushes to catch you should you slip off the edge.</p>
    <p>The loop back is really fun as well, with an alternating series of climbs and descents that keep things interesting. Thankfully, the technical climbing section isn’t part of the loop descent, and you take a gradual, wide path back to the trail head. That was perfect for me, as I was pretty worn out by the time we started down. </p>
    <p>If you’re like me and are a little nervous about tackling the “Coop,” don’t be! There is a lot of fun to be had there, regardless of skill level or terrain preference. </p>
