    <p>If you are looking for great scenery and a great workout without all the technical difficulty of other trails, Northridge Loop is for you. The ridge runs east to west, with Ojai Valley on one side and Rose Valley on the other. The trail features amazing views of both valleys plus the Los Padres National Forest. </p>
    <p>There are a total of 6 trail heads spread out over the 14.5 mile loop, so there are plenty of places to get on or off the trail. Hiking is permitting along all trails, so ride with caution and don't override your stopping power.</p>
    <h3>Skill level</h3>
    <p>While the overall trail is fine for beginners, two spurs, Gridley and Pratt, are much narrower and technical, so be sure to check the signage before choosing a trail. </p>
    <p>While there are no steep drops or bombs on this trail, there are several areas of the trail that extend over bare rock. The paths are marked, but there are canyon areas that you should be aware of. Before starting any downhill section make sure you know the path!</p>

    <h3>Surface</h3>
    <p>Most of the lower trails are firebreak roads or other, wide access roads. As you climb, trails become single track and a bit more technical. There are patches of bare rock and loose rock is common on most downhill sections. If you choose to ascend via the Killabase Road trail head, the first quarter mile is paved path.</p>
    <h3>Notable features</h3>
    <p>While there aren’t any huge jumps or insanely technical sections of the trail, there are some areas that are worth taking the time to explore. Our favorite is known as “Jacob’s Ladder,” a 25 foot section of rail road ties, iron rebar, and carpet (yes carpet) strips just off the the Casidas Park firebreak. Climbing this makeshift purchase point is a joy, and presents a decent challenge to all but the serious competitive climber. Recently I’ve heard that some of the more adventurous bikers have been descending it as a series of jumps. If you want to give this a try you need to be extra careful, the washout resumes at the bottom of it and is perched on the edge of a 700 foot drop. So consider yourself warned!</p>
    <p>Although it’s off the beaten path a bit, I strongly recommend taking the time to access the “Cow Chute” spur off the main loop. This is a single track spur that descends nearly 2000 feet off the main ridge with high, banked switchbacks. The path is mostly clear of loose rocks and obstacles, making it the most fun descent on the trail. The downside? It’s a spur only, once you’ve run it you’ll have to climb back up.</p>
    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
    <p>It’s not the biggest, it’s not the highest, and it’s not the most technical trail in Ojai, but in my opinion, it’s the best. It has an amazing variety of surfaces and trail types, so much so that you really can say there is something for everyone on the Northridge. Check it out, and you’ll be taking your friends back up the trail over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>I also want to mention that on June 22<sup>nd</sup> of every year, the Ojai Biking Club sponsors a trail cleanup day. If you want to help out, or just join a good group of folks who love this trail, come by!</p>
